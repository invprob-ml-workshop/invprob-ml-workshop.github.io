Welcome to the website of the one-day workshop "[Regularisation for Inverse Problems and Machine Learning](https://invprob-ml-workshop.github.io/)", which will be held at the [Campus Jussieu](https://goo.gl/maps/AgoULSsBeL2beaZo7) (room 16-26-209) in Paris on November 19th 2019.

---------------------------
*Please notice that attendance to the workshop (including lunch) is free of charge, but registration is **mandatory** (you can register [here](#registration)).*

---------------------------

## What is this workshop about

The purpose of the workshop is to gather together people working on problems arising in different fields such as imaging, machine learning and inverse problems theory in order to underline similarities and differences of the regularisation approaches used  (Tikhonov, early stopping, implicit regularization...).
