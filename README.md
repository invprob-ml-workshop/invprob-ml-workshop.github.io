Welcome to the website of the one-day workshop "[{{ site.title }}](https://invprob-ml-workshop.github.io/)", which will be held at the [Campus Jussieu](https://goo.gl/maps/AgoULSsBeL2beaZo7) (room 16-26-209) in Paris on November 19th 2019.

---------------------------
The Workshop is now done, thanks to everyone participating. All the slides of the presentations are available, see the [program](https://invprob-ml-workshop.github.io/#program).

---------------------------

## What is this workshop about

The purpose of the workshop is to gather together people working on problems arising in different fields such as imaging, machine learning and inverse problems theory in order to underline similarities and differences of the regularisation approaches used  (Tikhonov, early stopping, implicit regularization...).


## Program

All the talks will be held in the room 16-26-209. Coffee breaks and lunch will be organized in the room 15-25-202.
