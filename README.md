Welcome to the website of the one-day workshop "[Regularisation for Inverse Problems and Machine Learning](https://invprob-ml-workshop.github.io/)", which will be held at the [Campus Jussieu](https://goo.gl/maps/AgoULSsBeL2beaZo7) (room 16-26-209) in Paris on November 19th 2019.

---------------------------
*Please notice that attendance to the workshop (including lunch) is free of charge, but registration is **mandatory** (you can register [here](#registration)).*

---------------------------

## What is this workshop about

The purpose of the workshop is to gather together people working on problems arising in different fields such as imaging, machine learning and inverse problems theory in order to underline similarities and differences of the regularisation approaches used  (Tikhonov, early stopping, implicit regularization...).


## Program

All the talks will be held in the room 16-26-209. Coffee breaks and lunch will be organized in the room 15-25-202

  **Title**: Deep learning as optimal control problems<br/>
  <details>
  <summary><b>Abstract:</b> <i>(click to unroll)</i></summary>
  <p>
  We consider recent works where deep neural networks have been interpreted as discretisations of an optimal control problem subject to an ordinary differential equation constraint. We review the first order conditions for optimality, and the conditions ensuring optimality after discretisation. This leads to a class of algorithms for solving the discrete optimal control problem which guarantee that the corresponding discrete necessary conditions for optimality are fulfilled. The differential equation setting lends itself to learning additional parameters such as the time discretisation. We explore this extension alongside natural constraints (e.g. time steps lying in a simplex) and compare these deep learning algorithms numerically in terms of induced flow and generalisation ability. We conclude by addressing the interpretation of this extension as iterative regularisation methods for inverse problems.This is joint work with Elena Celledoni, Matthias J. Ehrhardt, Brynjulf Owren and Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb.
